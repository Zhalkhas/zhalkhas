### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a versatile software engineer with experience across mobile, backend, embedded systems, and DevOps. I enjoy building robust, scalable systems—from secure smartphones to microservices powering modern platforms.

Currently, I'm focused on backend development in Go, cloud infrastructure, and exploring the world of functional and systems programming with tools like Nix, Gleam, and Zig.
