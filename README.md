# 👋 Hey There, I’m Zhalgas!

I'm a software engineer who's a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I've got broad interests that stretch from compiler construction and web/mobile app development all the way to writing homebrew software for the Nintendo 3DS. If it's techy and fun, I'm probably poking at it.

## The Academic Adventure

**Nazarbayev University, Astana** (2017–2021)
Bachelor of Computer Science

* Algorithms & Database Systems (of course, what CS degree goes without it?)
* Operating Systems & Compiler Construction (courses that I actually enjoyed)
* GPU Programming (because who doesn’t love parallel speed‑demon math and proprietary Nvidia software)
 
## My “Day Job” Chronicles

### 🛠️ Tsarka (2019–2021)

*Hardware Engineer & Full‑Stack Doer*

* Designed RESTful backends in Go (Echo + Gorm + SQLite—just basics, but it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
* Wrote embedded C for STM32 microcontrollers (those tiny beasts pack a punch)
* Went full circle: from PCB sketches to API routes
* Participated in development of new Android smartphone, from hardware to software

### 🛒 ToleGO (2020–2021)

*Full‑Stack Developer, Retail Reinventor*

* Built a self‑checkout system: Flutter mobile, bespoke device UI, and Go backend (Gin + Gorm + PostgreSQL)
* Deployed with Docker Compose—for that sweet, sweet scalability
* Cut checkout times, boosted smiles

### 📊 Buhta.com (2021–2023)

*Cross‑Platform Mobile Architect*

* Crafted a bookkeeping “superapp” in Flutter—offline‑first (SQLite caching FTW)
* Hooked it up via gRPC to a Go backend, thanks to Buf‑generated bindings
* Learned that “accounting automation” can actually be… fun?

### 👗 Garderob.kz (2022–2023)

*Sustainable Fashion & Code Migrator*

* Developed a Flutter app for buying/selling clothes (chat included—because style chit‑chat matters)
* Participated a migration from Node.js to Go (MongoDB + go‑chi = smooth sailing)
* Discovered that circular economy looks great in code, too

### 🍽️ Rise by Rootz (2023)

*Full‑Stack Developer, Restaurant Innovator*

* Built a Flutter frontend tied to a Go REST API
* Integrated iiko RMS so users could order, track, and drool over menus in real‑time
* Launched on Google Cloud Functions + MongoDB Atlas—for zero‑downtime delight

### 🚀 Gosolve (2024–Present)

*Golang gRPC Microservices & Polyglot Tinkerer*

* Crafting Golang microservices with gRPC (ever seen a gopher that haven't done that?)
* Dabbled in GraphQL schemas and resolvers using TypeScript
* Spiced things up with Python scripts for data wrangling and automation

## My Tech Stack

My main languages are Go and Dart—they’re the tools I reach for every day. I’ve worked with MongoDB and PostgreSQL for databases, and used Redis for caching. For deployment and orchestration, I’m comfortable with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

Recently, I’ve started using NixOS for my personal setups, and I’m in the process of migrating my side projects to Nix-based deployments. It's been a fun challenge—and honestly, kind of addictive - after years of using Linux and manually managing dotfiles, configs, scripts with Makefiles, having everything centralized in one place feels like a blessing.

I’ve also been exploring Zig because of its powerful metaprogramming and easy C bindings. And I’ve been digging into Gleam, a small functional language that runs on the BEAM (think: Elixir, Erlang)—it’s clean, fun, and feels like a fresh way to think about code.
